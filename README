Eclipse Integration for Karaf is the integration of the Apache Felix Karaf
application platform and the Eclipse IDE.

Notable features include:

    * An Eclipse Run/Debug launcher configuration that configures Karaf to run
      inside the workbench transparently to the developer
    * Automatic deployment of workspace plugin projects to running Karaf
      instances without copying files
    * A Target Platform Definition that allows developers to target only the
      bundles found in Karaf distributions
    * A Target Platform Provisioner that automatically constructs a target
      platform from any Karaf distribution on the user's local disk
    * JMX instrumentation of the Running/Debugging Karaf instance.
    * Eclipse views that display the Bundle and Service status of Karaf
      instances
    * Web Tools Platform integration including:
          o Karaf server runtime with associated classpath maintenance
          o Karaf runtime locator that scans local disks for compatible Karaf
            distributions
